# LionType

I am trying to build an typing game in js using MERN , the first version will be something like MonkeyType.

## Client side (Front end)
  
-> using Vite as build tool with React as it's lightweight and fast.          
-> using tailwindcss as css-framework as it's a flexible and reliable with zero runtime.  

## Server side (Back end)
  
-> using express.js with node to support React from server side  
-> using mongoDB as database becuase it works!
